Word Meaning Finder - A Dictionary App using an API allows users to find word meanings by fetching data from an online dictionary API. The app takes a word as input, sends a request to the API, and displays its definition. It features a simple UI for searching words, handles API responses efficiently, and presents meanings in a readable format.
